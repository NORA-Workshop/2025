		    Agents have experienced significant growth in recent
		    years, largely due to the rapid technological advancements
		    of Large Language Models (LLMs). Although these agents
		    benefit from LLMsâ€™ advanced generation proficiency, they
		    still suffer from catastrophic forgetting and a limited
		    context window size compared to the agentsâ€™ needs in terms
		    of contextual information. Knowledge Graphs (KGs) are a
		    powerful paradigm for structuring and managing connected
		    pieces of information while unlocking deeper insights than
		    traditional methods. Their value is immense for tasks that
		    require context, integration, inter-linking, and
		    reasoning. However, this power comes at the cost of
		    significant upfront and ongoing investment in
		    construction, curation, and specialised expertise. The
		    NORA workshop aims at analysing and discussing emerging
		    and novel practices, ongoing research efforts and
		    validated or deployed innovative solutions that showcase
		    the growing synergy between LLMs agents and KGs.

			<h3>Workshop Description</h3>
			  <p>
			    The recent proliferation of large language models (LLMs)
			    has opened the doors for new paradigms that benefit many
			    applications like intelligent assistants, content creation
			    & summarisation, code generation & debugging, and
			    knowledge discovery, to name a few. Such applications are
			    achieved through prompt engineering & in-context learning,
			    retrieval augmented generation, fine-tuning & alignment,
			    and function calling & tool usage. These families of
			    techniques can be used on their own or combined for better
			    results.
			  </p>
			  <p>
			    Thanks to the constantly improving reasoning and function
			    calling capabilities of LLMs, LLM-based agents have
			    attracted more attention. While performing their allocated
			    tasks, these agents usually need to accumulate memory and
			    feedbacks from tool calls and maintain a long run of these
			    tasks. Consequently, they can easily exceed the context
			    window size, explode costs, and degrade both latency and
			    performance, due to their growing usage of tokens.
			  </p>
			  <p>
			    Depending on their tasks, agents usually need access to
			    minimal portions of semantic memory (i.e. facts), episodic
			    memory (i.e. events), and procedural memory
			    (i.e. instructions). However, it remains challenging for
			    agents to select relevant examples from different
			    memories, especially in large-scale applications (e.g.,
			    personal memories for personal assistance).
			  </p>
			  <p>
			    Knowledge Graphs (KGs) model data and knowledge in a
			    structured and explicit format known as graphs. Thanks to
			    this native structure, they have demonstrated great
			    capabilities in capturing rich semantics and connections
			    between entities and concepts in both closed and open
			    domains. This feature has enabled both 1) complex logical
			    reasoning, which is needed for multi-hop queries and
			    deriving new implicit knowledge from explicit facts; and
			    2) graph-based learning through richer features of the
			    structured data. However, curating knowledge can be
			    challenging, especially from heterogeneous data sources
			    and formats (e.g., personal assistants). As a consequence,
			    large-scale and industrial applications' scenarios are
			    even more impacted by this bottleneck, which thereby lower
			    the adoption of pure KG-based solutions in some Industrial
			    use-cases.
			  </p>
			  <p>
			    Therefore, this <b>first</b> edition of the workshop aims
			    to unveil the emerging yet growing interplay between two
			    key paradigms of recent AI systems: Agents and Knowledge
			    Graphs. On the one hand, the efficiency and performance of
			    agentic systems can benefit greatly from KGs as a
			    structured data model and reasoning foundation, especially
			    in designing and implementing their various memories. On
			    the other hand, KGs can leverage the advanced linguistic
			    capabilities of LLM agents in extracting, computing and
			    engineering knowledge from unstructured, multi-modal &
			    multi-lingual data sources.
			  </p>
			  <p>
				  In addition to the poster session and presentation of accepted 
				  submissions, the workshop will feature some keynote talks and 
				  a panel discussion.
