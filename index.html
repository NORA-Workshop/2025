	    Agents have experienced significant growth in recent
	    years, largely due to the rapid technological advancements
	    of Large Language Models (LLMs). Although these agents
	    benefit from LLMs’ advanced generation proficiency, they
	    still suffer from catastrophic forgetting and a limited
	    context window size compared to the agents’ needs in terms
	    of contextual information. Knowledge Graphs (KGs) are a
	    powerful paradigm for structuring and managing connected
	    pieces of information while unlocking deeper insights than
	    traditional methods. Their value is immense for tasks that
	    require context, integration, inter-linking, and
	    reasoning. However, this power comes at the cost of
	    significant upfront and ongoing investment in
	    construction, curation, and specialised expertise. The
	    NORA workshop aims at analysing and discussing emerging
	    and novel practices, ongoing research efforts and
	    validated or deployed innovative solutions that showcase
	    the growing synergy between LLMs agents and KGs.

        <div class="bs-component">
	  <p>
	    The recent proliferation of large language models (LLMs)
	    has opened the doors for new paradigms that benefit many
	    applications like intelligent assistants, content creation
	    & summarisation, code generation & debugging, and
	    knowledge discovery, to name a few. Such applications are
	    achieved through prompt engineering & in-context learning,
	    retrieval augmented generation, fine-tuning & alignment,
	    and function calling & tool usage. These families of
	    techniques can be used on their own or combined for better
	    results.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Thanks to the constantly improving reasoning and function
	    calling capabilities of LLMs, LLM-based agents have
	    attracted more attention. While performing their allocated
	    tasks, these agents usually need to accumulate memory and
	    feedbacks from tool calls and maintain a long run of these
	    tasks. Consequently, they can easily exceed the context
	    window size, explode costs, and degrade both latency and
	    performance, due to their growing usage of tokens.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Depending on their tasks, agents usually need access to
	    minimal portions of semantic memory (i.e. facts), episodic
	    memory (i.e. events), and procedural memory
	    (i.e. instructions). However, it remains challenging for
	    agents to select relevant examples from different
	    memories, especially in large-scale applications (e.g.,
	    personal memories for personal assistance).
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Knowledge Graphs (KGs) model data and knowledge in a
	    structured and explicit format known as graphs. Thanks to
	    this native structure, they have demonstrated great
	    capabilities in capturing rich semantics and connections
	    between entities and concepts in both closed and open
	    domains. This feature has enabled both 1) complex logical
	    reasoning, which is needed for multi-hop queries and
	    deriving new implicit knowledge from explicit facts; and
	    2) graph-based learning through richer features of the
	    structured data. However, curating knowledge can be
	    challenging, especially from heterogeneous data sources
	    and formats (e.g., personal assistants). As a consequence,
	    large-scale and industrial applications' scenarios are
	    even more impacted by this bottleneck, which thereby lower
	    the adoption of pure KG-based solutions in some Industrial
	    use-cases.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Therefore, this <b>first</b> edition of the workshop aims
	    to unveil the emerging yet growing interplay between two
	    key paradigms of recent AI systems: Agents and Knowledge
	    Graphs. On the one hand, the efficiency and performance of
	    agentic systems can benefit greatly from KGs as a
	    structured data model and reasoning foundation, especially
	    in designing and implementing their various memories. On
	    the other hand, KGs can leverage the advanced linguistic
	    capabilities of LLM agents in extracting, computing and
	    engineering knowledge from unstructured, multi-modal &
	    multi-lingual data sources.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		  In addition to the poster session and presentation of accepted 
		  submissions, the workshop will feature some keynote talks and 
		  a panel discussion.
